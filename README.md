This repository contains the source code of my personal website.
News, projects, publication and paper are regularly updated.
It's build using HTML and CSS, and with the help of my elder son [CÃ´me](https://comecattin.github.io/index.html). You can find the online deployed version following [this link](https://rodolphecattin.github.io).
