	<p>My collaborators and I are studying the relationship between seismic cycle deformation, geologic structures and internal-external forcing.
	Based on field observations, seismological and geodetic measurements, and remote sensing data, we develop experimental
	and numerical modelling accounting for tectonic and erosion processes. Our work is driven by an attempt to deepen our understanding of the
	dynamic of the lithosphere. These activities are mainly performed along the Himalayan arc (Nepal and Bhutan)</p>
	<p> Currently active projects concern:
		<br>- Near surface geophysical imaging.
		<br>- Relationship between tectonic and erosion.
		<br>- Monitoring of spatio-temporal changes in stream dynamics.
		<br>- Lateral variations along the Himalayan arc.
		<br>- Influence of tectonic slip history, seismic or aseismic, on the land surface.
		<br>- Measuring magnetic and gravimetric fields from high-altitude balloons.
